# 7-Segment-display

In this project , the 8051 microcontroller is interfaced with 2 seven segment display using a mutiplexer. As the count from one display begins from 0 and ends at 9 , the following step will change the value of the second display and the first segment display will begin counting from 0 again, following the same steps till both the segment display have the same count displayed as 9. The counter gets reset after this nad this process is followed again. Many 7-segment display can be interfaced and the process can move on.

The simulation is performed in Proteus 8 professional and the code is written in c language with the help of keil Uvision5 software.
